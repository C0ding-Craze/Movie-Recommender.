# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System  

A Python-based **content-based movie recommendation system** that suggests similar movies based on **genres** and **average ratings**.  
This project leverages **TF-IDF Vectorization** and the **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** algorithm with cosine similarity for accurate recommendations.

## Features  

- Computes recommendations for a given movie title  
- Uses **cosine similarity** on movie genres to find similar titles  
- Sorts recommended movies by **average user ratings**  
- Simple **command-line interface**
